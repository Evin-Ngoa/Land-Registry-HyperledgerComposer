## What's this?

This repository uses the Hyperledger Composer Javascript API to interact with a private blockchain. There is **ONLY** the Javascript code. The definition of the business network and the environment setup is explained in this [article](https://www.damiencosset.com/getting-started-hyperledger-composer-private-blockchains/).

This application is a little command line tool to interact and use the Javascript API provided by the Composer framework. We are using a land registry business network in this application.

To play with it:

- You **NEED** to have the proper environment setup ( explained in the article above )
- Clone the repo and run `npm install`
- Make sure the composer runtime is installed and deployed
- Enter commands and have fun!
